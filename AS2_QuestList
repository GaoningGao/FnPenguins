#================#

Given how the signing up for specific assignments took surprisingly
long last time, and also just for the sake of the better organization
of this project, I've already assigned tasks for everybody by name.

If there is a deadline for a specific assignment, the date for it is given.

--------/\
 David <||>
--------\/

* [i-3Ï€-sin x] Save the situation when sh#t goes south

* [08-01-2018] Create the most-basic, fundamental functions for the AI 
	/ai.c, .h/

* Write a library for some cool OS-specific command line utilities
	/env.c, .h/

* Improve the AI to the point where it can actually win a game

* [08-01-2018] Create a compileable main.c file for a program that will
	do the following:
	1. Read values for max_players and max_pngns from the user
	2. Randomly generate a map (using the existing generate_map() function)
	3. Set the remaining values for the "gmdt" struct, so that it represents the very start of the game
	4. Save the collected data to a file (using the existing save_file() function)

* Possibly improve the generate_map() function a bit. The minimal and maximal size can be given as parameters,
	instead of declaring them as constants inside the function.

* [08-01-2018] Work with David on the AI [look up his assignments]

* Alter the print_map() function, make it look cool and more readable

 Seden |
-------/

* [08-01-2018] Correct the mainauto.c and mainsemi.c files with respect to the given comments.

* [08-01-2018] Write a mainint.c file for the interactive mode. You might use the existing main.c file as an...
	...inspiration.

-------/

* Change the control.c functions, so that they take a pointer to struct Gmdt as an argument.

* [08-01-2018] Improve the is_move_possible() function, so that it allows only for proper movement. Put some
	restrictions on that teleportation power the penguins currently posses.

* Come up with a way to pervent cheating (when using the One-Step versions of the game)
